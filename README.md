A simple application to visualize how a scheduler plans the distribution of processes with different ready and execution times and deadlines. You can simulate up to 22 different processes on 1 to 4 CPUs with different scheduling strategies.

Note: The "Round Robin"-Scheduler has always just 1 CPU available.

Since this is part of a project for university there are additionally some small functions to show the impact of different ready times and orders of processes on the overall scheduler-performance. Use the -h or --help flag to see more information on how to run these functions.
